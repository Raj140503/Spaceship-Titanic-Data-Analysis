# Spaceship Titanic Data Analysis

**Tools used:** Python (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

**Content:** Exploratory data analysis, imputing null values, feature engineering, model building and tuning.

**Notes:**

This is what I did to get an 80.5% accuracy on my Spaceship Titanic competition submission, as pretty much a beginner. But it is far from perfect and I would really appreciate any constructive feedback on this project.
Since I knew extremely little about all the machine learning models and hyperparameters and what-not when I was working on this, I just decided to follow the basics and do my best to fill null values as accurately as possible. Then I just trained and predicted using the basic models that I knew, and a couple I know nothing about (haha dw I'll learn them soon).
If you wish, you can directly use the final dataset that I created in this notebook and used for prediction here.
And this is the notebook in this competition that helped me a lot on this project. Basically gave me a sense on how to view data, and how to create more from what I have. The new features that I use are the ones created in this notebook.
With all that out of the way, let's get started :)
